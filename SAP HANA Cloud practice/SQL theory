GROUP BY - USED WITH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

AS - IS USED WIH AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS (MIN, MAX)

The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions. 
It cannot use WHERE because the aggregate functions are evaluated after WHERE clause. 

offset is used when we want to display middle columns of the database table
Eg: Q) List the next five Pixar movies sorted alphabetically 
    A) SELECT title FROM movies order by title desc limit 4;

WHERE clause - Placed before the GROUP BY clause. Cannot contain aggregate functions (e.g., SUM(), AVG(), COUNT()).
Eg: SELECT ProductName, Price
    FROM Products
    WHERE Price > 50;
HAVING clause - Placed after the GROUP BY clause. Can and often does contain aggregate functions
Eg:  SELECT Category, COUNT(ProductID) AS NumberOfProducts
    FROM Products
    GROUP BY Category
    HAVING COUNT(ProductID) > 10;

JOINS:
(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
