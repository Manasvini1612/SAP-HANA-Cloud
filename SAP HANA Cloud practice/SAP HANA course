SAP HANA Cloud has two main service components that you can subscribe to in SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).
1)SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA database
2)SAP HANA Cloud, data lake


SAP HANA Cloud differs from other services offered in SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)in that it has a 
service level and a component level.
The service level of SAP HANA Cloud includes the administration tools that you use every day (for example, SAP HANA 
Cloud Central, SAP HANA cockpit, and so on).
The component level of SAP HANA Cloud includes database components such as SAP HANA Cloud, 
SAP HANA database and SAP HANA Cloud, data lake. Components have different release strategies (frequency, dates,
automatic upgrades) from each other and from the SAP HANA Cloud service level. 
This understanding is important when performing tasks like upgrading or learning about changes.
